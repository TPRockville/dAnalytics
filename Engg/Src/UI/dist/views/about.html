<h2>About This Site</h2> <p> dAnalytics is a prototype developed in response to the General Services Administration (GSA) Agile Delivery Services Request for Quotation - 4QTFHS150004. The prototype was developed to better meet public needs, and to facilitate easy and intuitive consumption of adverse event data provided by <a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">open.fda.gov</a>. Users need consumer friendly mechanisms to understand adverse events that may be associated with the drugs they have been prescribed. Data surrounding adverse drug reaction is collected and made available for public consumption by FDA. dAnalytics uses this publically available Drug Adverse Event dataset to explain spikes in the data and correlate this to any drug recalls, emergency room visits or patient discharges. This prototype also allows users to filter data by factors such as weight, gender, and age so that they can have a more personalized and meaningful user experience. </p> <h2>About The Data</h2> <p> This site uses publicly-available health-related data from <a href="https://open.fda.gov/" target="_blank">open.fda.gov</a> and medical care claims, discharge data, emergency room datasets accessed from <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/" target="_blank">healthcare.gov</a>. </p> <h2>About The Developer</h2> <p> <a href="http://tpgsi.com/">TurningPoint Global Solutions</a> is an independently appraised CMMI Level 3 software development firm that leverages Agile Software Development best practices to deliver user centric solutions for Big Data Analytics, Fraud, Waste, and Abuse, and Mobility to leading health agencies including FDA, CMS, DHA, VA, and HRSA.
