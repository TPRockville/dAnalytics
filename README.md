#Drug Analytics Development Approach
http://danalytics.tpgsi.com

dAnalytics is a prototype developed in response to the General Services Administration (GSA) Agile Delivery Services Request for Quotation - 4QTFHS150004. The system analyzes the Drug Adverse Event dataset from OpenFDA API to explain spikes in the data and correlate this to any drug recalls, emergency room visits or patient discharges.  The following outlines the approach used to develop the prototype. 

The project was initiated by identifying a small, focused team comprised of a Product Owner (Lead), Architect and DevOps engineers. The project team was selected because of their experience in modern digital services and the Big Data Analytics technology stack, including DevOps techniques like continuous integration and continuous deployment. Project Manager David Hong, reporting to Bangalore Shivacharan CEO, plays the role of the Product Owner. He has complete and final authority over the scope of the project and features to be implemented, and is ultimately responsible for how well the product meets the needs of its users . His background in similar projects and technical expertise makes him an ideal person to lead this project. His responsibilities include ensuring that features are built, managing feature and bug backlogs, as well as budget management. The team is sub divided into Requirements team led by Jayachandran Arumugam  and the DevOps team led by Satya Govindu. The DevOps team is further divided into Rest API, Hadoop and UI team. The team worked in two shifts to maximize the productivity. 

The goal for the requirements team was to include real people in the design process from the beginning to ensure a full understanding of what consumers need informed all technical and design decisions. Based on the discussions, we formulated a set of hypotheses and created and prioritized use cases to test them with the user group. Some of the hypotheses were proven false and we had to pivot and refine the use case. Hypotheses that were proven as a result of this exercise were:

1. Patients prescribed drugs by their doctors need a credible data source to obtain information about adverse events associated with that of a drug(s).

2. Users Patients would like to know if they are vulnerable to these adverse events drugs based on their gender, weight, age, etc. Does the drug affect a particular age group or sex more than others? Is there any adverse effect of the combination of drugs that the user is taking? 

3. What has causedfactors are associated with the ‘spikes’ in the adverse events? Can this be explained by some other occurrencesIs there a correlation with some other event?

The use cases and the UI prototype were refined iteratively with the user groups to ensure that it continued to meet user needs. To ensure user success, the final UI was ‘Human Centric’, simple, intuitive, and renders on both mobile and desktop browsers. Tooltips  Help text have been added to provide information about the fields and graph. To meet the accessibility needs meet the needs of all potential users, the interface is also section 508 compliant.  
dAnalytics was developed using modern open source technologies that are platform independent, including Java 1.8, Hadoop, Maria DB, Spring, Angular JS, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and Gradle.  We have chosen proven open source technologies that are platform independent. dAnalytics works in an ‘online’ and ‘offline’ mode.  In the online mode, we query the OpenFDA API. In Offline mode, we query the same data stored in our database.  The offline mode enables dAnalytics to run independently of the OpenFDA API, making it available even when the OpenFDA API is offline. The local databaseDB enables us to enhance the APIs in future.  The dataset from Open FDA is downloaded and processed with Hadoop and loaded into a Star Schema in Maria DB. The AngularJS UI interacts with the Maria DB through RESTful Web Services to render the UI.  To reduce risk of failure and to allow working software to be delivered as soon as possible, we employed an Agile development Methodology. User stories were created in GitHub and assigned to the team. The sub teams have forked from  the master code base . We have also enforced a code review step before the merge to the master code base.  GitHub is used for assigning tasks and defect tracking. The progress is monitored through twice-a-day standup meetings with a hand off to the 2nd shift. 

To ensure that our system is able to meet spikes traffic and user demand, we have deployed dAnalytics using IaaS provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Nnon limiting software architecture of dAnalytics, coupled with AWS resource scaling makes this a highly available and high performing solution. The system health is monitored in real time using Amazon CloudWatch and Monit, an open source tool to monitor processes. The tools automatically alert the system administrator when there is any spike in the load. The DevOps team continuously integrated, tested and deployed to verify application performance. The team added features in the 5  9 day period and developed an innovative, scalable, mobile and desktop digital service.
